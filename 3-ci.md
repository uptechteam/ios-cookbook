# CI/CD

Continous Integration is an important part of our development process. It allows us to move fast and be confident in our code. We use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for the continuous integration.

# App Configurations

We maintain 4 different app configurations:

1. **Development** - used for the local development only.
2. **QA** - used for internal QA testing.
3. **Staging** - public Beta testing.
4. **Production** - App Store version.

# Workflow

CI/CD Workflow consist of several pipelines:
1. **Test Pipeline** - each commit in `feature/` branch triggers a Test Pipeline. Test pipeline verifies that app can be built and tests successeds.
2. **Automatic Deploy Pipeline** - each commit in `develop` branch triggers an Automatic Deploy Pipeline. This pipeline builds, tests the app, deploys a **QA** build and bumps build number of the app.
3. **Manual Deploy Pipeline** - is triggered manually via API call to our CI provider. CI takes the latest code on `develop` or `master` and deploys **Staging** or **Production** build accordingly.

# How to setup CI/CD for your project?

## 1. Setup fastlane

fastlane is a shortcut for day-to-day developers tasks. It saves our time by automating the boring things like building and deploying the app or adding a device to the developer profile.

fastlane scripts are written in Ruby. The main file is called **Fastfile**. Usually Fastfile consists of several **lanes**. Lane is just a sequence of **actions**, such as `build_ios_app`, `hockey` or `slack`. For more information refer to the [docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools). 

#### Basic Setup

The [basic Fastfile](resources/Fastfile-Basic) contains the minimalistic set of lanes, needed to build and deploy a project on a CircleCI. Lane `test` just builds the project and runs the tests suite. Usually, this lane is run on every push to any branch. Lane `deploy` is a bit more complicated as it has more steps:

1. Retrieve certificates using `match`.
2. Build the app.
3. Deploy an app to the HockeyApp
4. Send a message to the slack channel.

`deploy` lane is run on every merge to the `develop` branch.

#### Advanced Setup

Usually, basic setup is not enough, as we have several application configurations and we deserve to have nice things. In the [advanced Fastfile example](resources/Fastfile-Advanced) you can check typical fastlane configuration used in our projects. There are lanes for running tests, deploying Staging and Production builds, helper lanes for syncing provisioning profiles and adding a new iOS device to the developer profile.

Whoa, a lot of Ruby code! Don't be afraid, it's pretty easy to follow. In addition, setting up the fastlane on the project makes you feel like a cool dev-ops ðŸ˜Ž 

Code signing part is described in the [code signing chapter](2-code-signing.md). If you use match there will be no problems, just grant your CI machine SSH access to the certificates repo.

## 2. Configure the CircleCI

CircleCI uses `config.yml` file for configuration, which is located in `.circleci/config.yml`. **It's  role is to determine which pipeline to use in the given context and to setup the environment for the fastlane execution.**

#### Example

A configuration file example - [config.yml](resources/circle-config.yml). It consists of 4 jobs which represent our CI pipelines: 
* `build-and-test` - Test Pipeline
* `deploy_qa` - Automated Deploy Pipeline
* `deploy_staging` and `deploy_production` - Manual Deploy Pipelines

#### Workflow triggers

At the very bottom of `config.yml` lays description of our workflow. It states, that 
* we will run `build-and-test` job on push to every branch **except** `develop`; 
* we will run `deploy_qa` job on every push to the `develop`.

To trigger a Manual Deploy Pipeline, you should use a CircleCI API call with required job name and branch to use for build:

```
curl -u {TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]={JOB_NAME} \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/uptechteam/{PROJECT_NAME}/tree/{BRANCH_NAME}
```

> Please, refer to the [config.yml documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/) for more information about the structure of the configuration file.

## 2. Configure the Github Actions
### Overview
GitHub Actions allows us to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly in our GitHub repositories. It supports CI/CD, helping in building, testing, and deploying code.
### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:

* A GitHub repository for your iOS project.
* Fastlane set up in your project. Follow the iOS getting started guide to initialize [Fastlane](http://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/).
  Prerequisites:

First of all you need to set up fastlane, you can do that with that link: 
Youâ€™ll end up with a fastlane directory, a Fastfile, and an Appfile.

### Step 1: Set Up Fastlane

1. The Appfile contains essential information about your app and your Apple developer account. Update the Appfile with your application's bundle identifier and Apple ID:
```
    app_identifier "awesomeproject.uptech.team"
    apple_id "username@uptech.team"
```

#### 2. Next update Fastfile

1. The Fastfile defines the lanes for our CI/CD tasks. Rename your custom lane to something more descriptive, such as testflight_lane.

```
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Builds, archives, and uploads IPA to TestFlight"
  lane :testflight_lane do
      cert
      sigh
  end
end

# Note: If you don't have permission to edit the Fastfile, change file permissions using:
* chmod -R u+w "/pathToYourFastlaneFolder"
* sudo chown -R $(whoami) "/pathToYourFastlaneFolder"

```
cert - automates the creation and renewal of iOS code signing certificates.  
sigh - automates the creation and renewal of provisioning profiles.

This is simple example of simple fastlane file you can use [code signing tutorial using match](2-code-signing.md) or run fastlane ```fastlane testflight_lane``` in terminal.
When you launch Fastlane, it will ask you to enter your account password, enter it.

You will only need to do this once - fastlane will remember it and you won't need to enter anything the next time you launch it.

Now the certificate and provision profiles are downloaded and installed. It remains to specify the desired target in the Xcode General tab.

We have prefilled 2 files [basic Fastfile](resources/Fastfile-Basic) and [advanced Fastfile example](resources/Fastfile-Advanced) there you can observe advanced settings of fastfile.

#### 3. Set Up Gemfile
A Gemfile is crucial for managing Ruby dependencies in your project, including Fastlane and other required gems. Create a Gemfile in your project directory with the following content:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "fastlane"
```
Then, run bundle install to install the specified gems. This ensures that the correct versions of all dependencies are used.


### Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions
Full documentation you can see here: [GitHubActions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)

Create Workflow Directory

Create a directory for your GitHub Actions workflows in your repository. 

Navigate to your GitHub repository, select the "Create new file" option, and enter the following path: .github/workflows/pullRequest.yml.

Note: The filename pullRequest.yml is an example and can be customized to reflect the purpose of your workflow. For instance, you might name it ci.yml for continuous integration tasks, but another part should be exactly ``` .github/workflows ```.

* Here is an example of basic job: [GitHubAction Basic file](resources/gitHubAction-Basic.yml), this job will run unit tests each time you make PR into develop branch.
* You can do more actions if you want, here is file of advanced:   [GitHubAction Basic file](resources/gitHubAction-Advanced.yml) it wont be triggered automatically, it is need to be triggered manuallyfrom github.

#### Final Steps
* Commit and Push: Commit your workflow files and push them to your repository.
* Trigger Workflows: Open a pull request to the develop branch to see the pull request workflow in action. Manually trigger the deployment workflow from the Actions tab on GitHub.

### 3. PROFIT ðŸš€

- we've automated part of our workflow;
- our code is always buildable and tests are green;
- the latest executable build is always available to download.
