# Architecture

By architecture here we mean a set of design patterns used across the entire application. We believe that code quality is much more important than specific architecture patterns.

However we have a number of reasons to use same architecture for every project we build.

## Why?

- Have a completed solution for new projects
- Decrease development time by reusing established principles and techniques for solving similar problems
- Create consistent codebase to lower the barrier to entry for switching developers between existing projects

## Requirements

- Testable, separated view and business logic
- Lightweight, small amount or no boilerplate code needed
- Easy to integrate to existing projects
- Multipurpose, suitable for all kinds of apps
- Designed for use with reactive framework (RxSwift)

## MVVM

Our needs satisfy fine-tuned [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel) architecture.

Architecture is heavily dependent on [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) framework, but may be easily used with any other reactive framework. 

Entire application is divided into modules, each module represents a screen.
Typical module consists of following parts.
- ðŸ“¦ [Props](#props)
- ðŸŽ† [View](#view)
- ðŸš¦ [View Model](#viewmodel)
- ðŸšƒ [View Controller](#viewcontroller)
- ðŸ”€ [Navigation](#navigation)

### Props <a id="props"></a>

Immutable struct that contains all content needed for module to be displayed.

It is important to transmit entire view state using this object. This way view cannot enter invalid state because of incorrect configuration order.

Props must operate only with plain models created specifically for describing state of view. This means you cannot pass domain models (e.g. `Message` model initialized from JSON response) to view. You must create separated model inside module's props naming scope or outside (e.g. `MessageProps`) if you reuse view between different screens. This quality enables implementing view (and reducing QA cycle time) separately from business logic.

Props object should conform to `Equatable`, so it is required to contain only equatable value type properties.

```swift
struct TeamChatProps: Equatable {
    struct Message: Equatable {
        let body: String
        let senderName: String
        let senderAvatarUrl: URL
        let createdAt: Date
    }

    let messages: [Message]
    let title: String
}
```

### View <a id="view"></a>

`UIView` subclass and `.xib` interface builder file with layout. 

This module's part is completely optional, everything from it can be easily moved to view controller and functionality will remain same. However, we recommend implementing view separately from view controller to avoid growth of view controller's code base and enable reusing view if it will be needed in future.

All views are required to implement `render(props:)` method, which restores state of view from props object.
This method must always bring view to same state for same props (view state must not depend on previous calls).
If you implement animations, your view can rely on its previous state to make a proper transition. For example, UITableView's data source may require previous rendered sections array to differentiate between it and current sections and do animated batch updates.

```swift
final class TeamChatView: UIView, NibInstantiatable {
    @IBOutlet private weak var tableView: UITableView!
    @IBOutlet private weak var titleLabel: UILabel!
    private let dataSource = TeamChatDataSource()
    private var props: TeamChatProps?

    func render(props: TeamChatProps) {
        if props.title != self.props?.title {
            titleLabel.text = props.title
        }    

        if props.messages != self.props?.messages {
            dataSource.render(messages: props.messages)
        }

        self.props = props
    }
}
```

### View Model <a id="viewmodel"></a>

This object performs all business logic of module through transforming reactive inputs into outputs.

Inputs are sequences of events from view layer, that trigger network, services etc. Example sequences: `viewWillAppear`, `buyButtonTap`, `messageSelect`.
Outputs are sequences of events for view layer. Outputs contain cold observable sequence of props and hot observable sequences of triggers. This triggers include alerts, navigation to other screens etc.

To reuse functionality between different view models, we move use cases to service objects.

When screen functionality grows view model becomes complex and hard to maintain. To scale it linearly we implement Redux-like state inside view model.

```swift
final class TeamChatViewModel {
    struct Inputs {
        let viewWillAppear: Observable<Void>
    }

    struct Outputs {
        let props: Observable<TeamChatProps>
        let alert: Observable<String>
    }

    private let networkProvider: NetworkProviderProtocol

    init(networkProvider: NetworkProviderProtocol = Dependencies.shared.networkProvider) {
        self.networkProvider = networkProvider
    }

    func makeOutputs(from inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs {
        let alertSubject = PublishSubject<String>()
        let isLoadingMessages = BehaviorSubject<Bool>(value: false)

        let messages = inputs.viewWillAppear
            .flatMapLatest { () -> Observable<[Messages]> in
                isLoadingMessages.onNext(true)
                return self.networkProvider.request(TeamMessagesTarget())
                    .catchError { error in
                        alertSubject.onNext(error.localizedDescription)
                        return .empty()
                    }
                    .do(onCompleted: { isLoadingMessages.onNext(false) })
            }
            .startWith([])
            .share(replay: 1, scope: .forever)

        let props = Observable.combineLatest(messages, isLoadingMessages) { ($0, $1) }
            // Function here shows how module's state transforms to view content.
            .map { messages, isLoadingMessages -> TeamChatProps in
                let propsMessages = messages
                    .map { message -> TeamChatProps.Message in
                        return TeamChatProps.Message(
                            body: message.body,
                            senderName: message.sender.name,
                            senderAvatarUrl: message.sender.avatarUrl,
                            createdAt: message.createdAt
                        )
                    }

                let title = isLoadingMessages ? "Loading" : "Team Chat"

                return TeamChatProps(
                    messages: propsMessages,
                    title: title
                )
            }

        return Outputs(
            props: props,
            alert: alertSubject
        )
    }
}
```

### View Controller <a id="viewcontroller"></a>

`UIViewController` subclass, module's entrance point. 

View controller doesn't contain any business logic, unlike with MVC. It strongly references to view model and view objects. In most cases view controller instantiates view and view model by itself, but it can also support injecting them using initializer. 

A typical view controller has a `bindViewModel()` method that binds view outputs to view model inputs and view model outputs to view inputs with reactive framework.

```swift
// TeamChatViewController.swift

final class TeamChatViewController: UIViewController {
    private lazy var teamChatView = TeamChatView.instantiateFromNib()
    private lazy var viewModel = TeamChatViewModel()
    private let disposeBag = DisposeBag()

    override func loadView() {
        self.view = teamChatView
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        bindViewModel()
    }

    private func bindViewModel() {
        let inputs = TeamChatViewModel.Inputs(
            viewWillAppear: self.rx.viewWillAppear
        )

        let outputs = viewModel.makeOutputs(from: inputs)

        outputs.props
            .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
            .bind { [weak self] in self?.render(props: $0) }
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)

        outputs.alert
            .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
            .bind { [weak self] in self?.showAlertController(message: $0) }
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)
    }

    private func render(props: TeamChatProps) {
        teamChatView.render(props: props)
    }
}
```

In cases where module requires some local dependencies (e.g. profile details screen require profile id to fetch info), view controller has custom initializer that passes its arguments to view model initializer.
```swift
// ProfileDetailsViewController.swift
...

init(profileId: String) {
    viewModel = ProfileDetailsViewModel(profileId: profileId)
    super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
}
```

### Navigation <a id="navigation"></a>

Since all view logic is inside view, view controllers are thin and navigation can be handled by them directly. This keeps architecture lightweight, since separate modules are represented by their view controllers and can be integrated to existing code base easily. 

To proceed navigation, view model triggers its view controller with hot observable output.
```swift
// TeamChatViewModel.swift

enum TeamChatRoute {
  case messageDetails(Message)
}

final class TeamChatViewModel {
  struct Inputs {
    ...
    let messageTap: Observable<ArrayIndex>
  }

  struct Outputs {
    ...
    let route: Observable<TeamChatRoute>
  }

  func makeOutputs(from inputs: Inputs) -> Outputs {
    ...

    let messageDetailsRoute = inputs.messageTap
      .withLatestFrom(state) { ... } // Retrieve message model from index
      .map(TeamChatRoute.messageDetails)

    return Outputs(
      ...
      route: messageDetailsRoute
    )
  }
}
```

```swift
// TeamChatViewController.swift

final class TeamChatViewController: UIViewController {
  ...

  func bindViewModel() {
    ...
    
    outputs.route
      .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
      .bind { [weak self] route in
        guard let `self` = self else { return }

        switch route {
        case let .messageDetails(message):
          let viewController = MessageDetailsViewController(message: message)
          self.navigationController?.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
        }
      }
      .disposed(by: disposeBag)
  }
}
```
